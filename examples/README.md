# 9DE Examples

These examples are **reference patterns** for the declarative framework direction.

Folders:

- `declarative/` — node-tree sketches (builder style)
- `settings/` — System Settings layouts as rows/surfaces
- `services/` — service dashboard/list patterns

Notes:

- The runtime API is still evolving. Treat these as patterns rather than a stable SDK.
- Assume heavy load: virtualize long lists, avoid redraw storms.
